# Trie(Prefix Tree)
A trie is also called digital tree, radix tree or prefix tree.
It is a kind of search tree which is used as an ordered tree data structure.
This data structure is used as an implementation of an associative array.

# Argorithm
A root node has an empty string, each of other nodes has a string or strings which is a common prefix of the strings associated with an ancestor node.
